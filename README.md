# K Project Overview
This project aims to explore using OAuth for authentication as well as exploring various undecided social media API's.

The original goal / plan was to have a Rails app backend / frontend that I could build a Chrome plugin for to automatically shorten links / tweet from after authorizing the app to post for you.
